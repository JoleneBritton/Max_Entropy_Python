# Max_Entropy_Python

This code compares two regulations methods for different pathways. 
Each pathway is in a folder. The functions utilized are in Basic_Functions
Equilibrator parses reactions from .dat folders
machine_learning_functions contains all functions to run a reinforcement learning program.
max_entropy_functions contains all functions to run a maximume entropy regulation program. 

To run:
Place all the code folders into a new folder, "new_folder". 
cd into new_folder inside python or make it your current working directory. 
Open one of the python files for a pathway, e.g. "GLUCONEOGENSIS"
